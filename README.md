# Books

Repository where I post starter files and solutions to exercises from my technical books. Each directory is equivalent to one physical book. If a series has 4 books, it will be equivalent to 4 directories.

# Language

In this repo I'm using language based on the language of concrete book, so mostly all of the books will be written in Polish language, since it's my native one.

# Get commit message script

This script allows me to generate and copy to the clipboard commit messages based on convention.
The structure of each commit is "Book name: Chapter name". I prefer to use this script instead of copying the
directory names all the time.

Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run:

```bash
python get_commit_message.py
```
